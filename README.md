# Apache-Kafka
### What Is Kafka?
It is generally used as a publish/subscribe messaging system, It allows us to publish and subscribe to a stream of records that can be categorized. Kafka is written in Java. It is often used in real-time streaming data architectures to provide real-time analytics.<p> Since Kafka is a fast, scalable, durable, and *fault-tolerant publish-subscribe messaging system*.</p>
### How does it work?
Applications (producers) send messages (records) to a Kafka node (broker) and messages are processed by other applications called consumers.Messages get stored in a topic and consumers subscribe to the topic to receive new messages.
A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it.

Topic get split into partitions of a smaller size for better performance and scalability.
